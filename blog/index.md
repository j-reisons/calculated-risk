Welcome to the website for my expected utility calculator project!

I believe expected utility models for portfolio choice are really nifty and underused in financial planning.  
I'm hoping I can convince you too.

* If you want a little more motivation than this, [head to the about page](/about).
* If you believe in trial-and-error over reading, [head straight to the calculator](/calculator).
* For a more didactic approach, [head to the case studies](/cases).
* For more exhaustive information, [head to the docs](/docs).

N.B. While the calculator technically works on mobile, it's by no means a pleasant experience: it was built with desktop in mind.
